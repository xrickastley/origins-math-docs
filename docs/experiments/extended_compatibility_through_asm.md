# Experiment: Extended Compatibility through ASM

### Affected Versions: 
- Origins: Math `>=1.4.0`

<hr>

This **Origins: Math** experiment introduces "Extended Compatibility through ASM".

This experiment is enabled by default, and it aims to extend the compatibility of **Origins: Math** with specific action and condition types from Origins/Apoli and more action and condition types added by other mods.

If an issue occurs on the specified [affected versions](#affected-versions) that worked in the previous **Origins: Math** versions and you think it is due to the experiment, kindly open up an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/xrickastley/origins-math/issues) with the **"Experiment: Extended Compatibility with ASM"** label. Please ensure that no issues of the same nature exist. 

On **Origins: Math** versions higher than or equal to `1.5.0`, you may disable this experiment through the config menu! Please ensure that [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) is installed first, as you will need it to access the actual config menu.
