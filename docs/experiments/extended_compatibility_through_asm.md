This **Origins: Math** experiment introduces "Extended Compatibility through ASM".

This alpha experiment aims to extend the compatibility of **Origins: Math** with specific action and condition types from Origins/Apoli and more action and condition types added by other mods.

If an issue occurs on the specified [affected versions](#affected-versions-140) that worked in the previous **Origins: Math** versions and you think it is due to the experiment, kindly open up an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/xrickastley/origins-math/issues) with the **"Experiment: Extended Compatibility with ASM"** label. Please ensure that no issues of the same nature exist.
